  # Note, this is seed data, changes here are not used at runtime, 
  # must run "rake subscription:plans" to load them into the database. 
  # But you can change this and re-run the rake task to update the database.
  # If you've added any app-specific limits to plans you can add them here
  #   name: name of the plan (required)
  #   rate_cents: cost of the plan in cents (0 or nil is free)
  #   interval: rate is for number of months (default 1). For example, an annual fee @ $25/month would have rate_cents: 30000 and interval: 12
  #   other attributes: are app-specific, be sure you've added them to the SubscriptionPlan migration
