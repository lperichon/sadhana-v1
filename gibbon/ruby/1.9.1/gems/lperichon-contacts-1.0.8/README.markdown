## Contacts

Fetch users' contact lists without asking them to provide their
passwords, as painlessly as possible.

Contacts provides adapters for:

 * Google
 * Yahoo!
 * Windows Live

## Basic usage instructions

First, register your application with the service providers you
require. Instructions below under "Setting up your accounts".

Now, create a consumer:

    consumer = Contacts::Google.new
    consumer = Contacts::Yahoo.new
    consumer = Contacts::WindowsLive.new
    # OR by parameter:
    # provider is one of :google, :yahoo, :windows_live
    consumer = Contacts.new_consumer(provider)

Now, direct your user to:

    consumer.authentication_url(return_url)

`return_url` is the page the user will be redirected to by the service
once authorization has been granted. You should also persist the
consumer object so you can grab the contacts once the user returns:

    session[:consumer] = consumer.serialize

Now in the request handler of the return_url above:

    consumer = Contacts.deserialize(session[:consumer])
    if consumer.authorize(params)
      @contacts = consumer.contacts
    else
      # handle error
    end

Here, `params` is the hash of request parameters that the user returns
with. `consumer.authorize` returns true if the authorization was
successful, false otherwise.

The list of `@contacts` are `Contacts::Contact` objects which have
these attributes:

 * name
 * emails

## Setting up your accounts

### Google

Set up your projects
[here](http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/RegistrationForWebAppsAuto.html).

 * When redirecting to an unverified domain (e.g., localhost), the
   user sees a warning when authorizing access.

What this means:

 * You can use the same consumer key for development as production.

### Yahoo

Set up your projects [here](https://developer.apps.yahoo.com/projects)

 * When a project's domain is verified, you must redirect to it.
 * When a project's domain is not verified, you can redirect anywhere, and the
   user sees a warning when authorizing access.

What this means:

 * Set up separate production and development projects.
 * Verify the domain of your production project. You will only be able to
   redirect to your production domain when using this key.
 * Don't verify the domain of your development project. You will be able to
   redirect to any domain when using this key.

## Windows Live

Set up your projects [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc287659.aspx).

 * There is no domain verification step.
 * The domain cannot be localhost, an IP address, or have a query string.
 * You must redirect to the project's domain, on any port, and the URL may not
   have a query string or fragment.
 * You must specify a privacy policy URL.

What this means:

 * Set up separate production and development projects.
 * For development, use a domain like myapp.local.
 * Map this domain to 127.0.0.1 in /etc/hosts or a local DNS server.
 * If you want to run your app on a different domain (e.g., localhost:3000),
   redirect the POST from Windows Live to a GET on the original domain. This
   ensures the popup window has the same origin as the opener page, in
   accordance with browser same origin policies.
